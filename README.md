iterative learning control on Arduino Due

This work was started for a master thesis at the Technical University of Berlin.
The aim of this work is to establish a closed loop control for the excitation of mechanical test setups.

Problem description:
When performing mechanical oscillating tests on non-linear structures, it is very hard to establish a 
sober excitation force of only one single frequency. 

Idea:
Usage of iterative learning control to improve the signal used to excite the mechanical non-linear 
structure from period to period.
